# Crime Data Analysis 
## Overview  
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of crime data collected from the Montgomery County, Maryland website. The goal is to gain deeper insights into crime patterns and trends using various data analysis techniques and models.

## Features
### Data Collection
The crime data was sourced from the official Montgomery County, Maryland website. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of the data used in this project.

### Data Recategorization
Before diving into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the data was recategorized for better understanding and interpretation. This step is crucial to ensure that the subsequent analysis is meaningful and insightful.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the underlying structure of the data, identify outliers and anomalies, and test underlying assumptions.

### Plotting
Several plots were generated to visualize the data and make sense of it. These plots can help in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships that might not be apparent from looking at raw data.

### Temporal Analysis
Temporal analysis was performed using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. This model is widely used in time series forecasting, and it can capture a suite of different standard temporal structures in the data.

### Geospatial Analysis
The project also involves geospatial analysis, which refers to the study of features and phenomena that occur in the physical space of the earth. In the context of this project, it involves mapping crime incidents using latitude and longitude data to identify geographical patterns in crime incidents.
